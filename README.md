Purpose-built Swift library for creating iOS applications.

Author: @rantingmong (Michael Ong | mong@rantingmong.net)

mongKit is the culmination of @rantingmong's experience with iOS development so far. This library removes unnecessary boilerplate code by standardizing code patterns and helpers.

## Contents
- `.core`: Common code for mongKit. Also contains general helper functions that can be used in an application.
- `.networking`: A swift-friendly endpoint construction API for calling a `URLSessionDataTask`.
- `.structure`: Code for structuring an application using `Coordinator`s and `Controller`s.
- `.view`: SwiftUI-inspired UIKit view construction with extensible style and layout configuration.
